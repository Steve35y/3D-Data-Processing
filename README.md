## Lab 1 - Semi Global Stereo Matching with Monocular Disparity Initial Guess

Lab 1 features a basic implementation of the Semi Global Block Matching (SGM) stereo matching algorithm with an additional feature: the integration of an initial guess of the disparity map obtained from a monocular depth estimation method.

### Overview

In this assignment, you will find code that implements the SGM stereo matching algorithm. Alongside the SGM implementation, you will be provided with stereo image pairs as input. Additionally, an initial guess of the disparity map will be provided, calculated using a recent data-driven monocular depth estimation method. This initial guess is generally quite accurate but defined up to a scalar factor.
